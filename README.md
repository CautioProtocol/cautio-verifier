Cautio Verifier

The Gold Standard for Forensic Data Integrity
The Cautio Verifier is a high-integrity, client-side application designed to validate Merkle inclusion proofs. It provides an immutable "Proof of Existence" and "Proof of Integrity" by anchoring data to global Time Stamping Authorities (TSA).

🌐 Live Portal
Official Verifier: https://cautioprotocol.github.io/cautio-verifier/

🛠 Core Functions
Cryptographic Validation: Supports Keccak-256 and SHA-256 hashing algorithms.

Time-Stamp Verification: Validates RFC 3161 compliant timestamps from DigiCert TSA.

Forensic Reporting: Generates self-contained PDF audit reports with deterministic Exit Codes.

Zero-Knowledge Execution: 100% client-side. No data is ever transmitted to a server.

🚀 Quick Start
Access: Navigate to the live portal or open index.html locally.

Verify: Drag and drop a .proof.json file (generated by the Cautio Engine) into the interface.

Audit: * Exit Code 0: Integrity Confirmed (Authentic).

Exit Code 1: Integrity Compromised (Tampered/Mismatch).

Export: Click Export Report (PDF) to generate a portable forensic record.

🏗 System Architecture
The verifier works in conjunction with the Cautio Engine. While the Engine handles the high-performance generation of Merkle Trees, the Verifier provides a public, transparent layer for third-party auditors to confirm the truth without needing access to the original source code.
